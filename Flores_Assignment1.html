	  <h1>Banned Books-- Oh My</h1>

      <p>The term “banned books” refers to printed materials that are either removed or under restricted access due to objections from community groups regarding their 		content. Book banning as a form of censorship is a long-standing practice, spanning over centuries. From political treatises and religious texts to literary 		fiction and easy readers, hundreds of books have been removed from library shelves over the years.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Semantics: Challenge vs Ban</h2>
	  
	  <p>While the two terms frequently appear together in this context, they refer to different states of being for banned books.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Challenge</h3>
	  
	  <p>To challenge a book means that an attempt has been made to remove the book. This goes beyond simply expressing a certain opinion, and instead results in the 		start of a formal process to get the book removed from circulation or the curriculum. In a library setting, this may come in the form of a patron submitting  a 		Request for Reconsideration.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Ban</h3>
	  
	  <p>A book is considered banned when it is actually removed. As staunch advocates of open access and intellectual freedom, librarians and teachers alike do 	their 		best to protect challenged materials from removal. As such, most challenges are unsuccessful.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Reasons Books Are Challenged</h2>
	  
	  <p>Books are challenged for a variety of reasons:</p>
	  	<ul>
		  <li>Sexually explicit</li>
		  <li>Offensive language</li>
		  <li>Unsuitable to age group</li>
		  <li>Racism</li>
		  <li>Violence</li>
		  <li>LGBTQIA+</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p> Usually, people challenge books done with the intention of protecting vulnerable community groups (such as children) from difficult information they are not equipped to process. That being said, librarians maintain that their primary duty is to facilitate access to information, not impede it. As stated by the <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/interpretations/minors">Access to Library Resources and Services for Minors</a>, solely parents have the chief responsibility of restricted access to information from their children as they see fit. </p>

		<h2>Why Read Banned Books?</h2>
		<p>Banned books deserve to be evaluated for what they are: works of literary merit. Moreover, as works of literature, banned books reflect a certain image of humanity that provides readers with a unique perspective. Through their pages, the stories of marginalized people and uncut history come to life. The ability of banned books to both undo and inspire readers speaks to their worth as written art. Perhaps this is why schools, bookstores, and libraries have taken to celebrating these books every year during Banned Book Week. </p>
		<h3>Banned Book Week</h3>
		<p><a href="https://bannedbooksweek.org/">Banned Book Week</a> is an annual campaign hosted by the American Library Association and Amnesty International. During this campaign, participating institutions and bookish affiliates highlight challenged and banned books in a week-long celebration of intellectual freedom.</p>
<p>Goals of Banned Book Week:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Encourage readers to examine banned books</li>
	<li>Promote the intellectual freedom schools and libraries provide</li>
	<li>Teach the power of literature</li>
	<li>Highlight the danger of stifling the availability of information in a free society.</li>			


<p>Banned Books Week 2021 will be held September 26 – October 2.</p>
